 <h6>Privacy Policy</h6>


<p>Your privacy is important to us.  We are committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you provide to us.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>This Privacy Policy explains how we use and process your personal data.  You will also find details of how to contact us if you have questions about your data.  Our Cookie Statement (below) will tell you now HalalJourney.com uses cookies and similar devices.
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>HalalJourney.com offers online travel-related services through our own website and mobile app, and through other online platforms like our partner's websites and social media.  Our Privacy Policy applies uniformly to all these platforms and any other means by which we have collected your data (e.g. if you deal with our Customer Service team).</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time.  To stay up-to-date with the changes, please visit this page regularly.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>

<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>What kind of personal information do we collect?</h6>

<p>In order for you to book any accommodation we display, we need to ask you for certain pieces of basic information – your name, contact details, the names of anybody traveling with you, and your payment information.  In addition to this, we also collect information from your computer. This can include your internet provider, the browser you use, and your language settings. There may also be situations when we receive information about you from others or automatically collect other details.  </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>Why do we collect and use your personal data?</h6>

<p>The primary reason we ask you for personal details is to administer your online bookings, ensure you get the best service possible, and to safeguard your information.  We also want to use your personal data to contact you and inform you about our latest services and special offers.</p> 
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How do we share your data with third parties?</h6>

<p>There are other parties integrated into the HalalJourney.com services in various ways and for various reasons.  The main reason is to share your reservation data with the accommodation provider to complete your reservation.  There may also be other parties which can receive some of your data.  These are parties we use to provide you with the HalalJourney.com services such as financial institutions, advertisers, or in some cases governmental authorities. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How do we process communications that you and your booked accommodations might send to us?</h6>

<p>HalalJourney.com can help you and accommodation providers exchange information and requests about the accommodation and existing reservations, directing the communications through HalalJourney.com.</p>  
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How do we use mobile devices?</h6>

<p>We offer free apps which we also collect and process personal data through.  This works very much the same way as our website, but they also allow you to use our location services. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How do we use social media?</h6>

<p>The use of social media may be integrated with the HalalJourney.com services in various ways which may involve us collecting some of your personal data or the social media provider receiving some of your information. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>

<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>What kind of personal information do we collect?</h6>

<b>Personal information you give to us</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>HalalJourney.com collects and uses information that you have provided to us. When you make a reservation, you are asked (as a minimum) for your name and email address.  We may also ask you for your home address, telephone number, payment information, the names of any guests traveling with you, and any preferences you may have for your stay. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>If you need to contact our customer service team, or engage with us through another avenue (such as on social media, or communicating with your accommodation provider on our site), we will collect information from you there.  After a stay, guests are sometimes asked to provide us with a review to help ensure future guests get exactly what they want.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>There are also other instances where you may provide us with information.  If, for example, you are browsing with your mobile device, you can enable HalalJourney.com to see your current location or grant access to your contact details.  This will assist us to provide you with the best possible service.  You can also open a user account with us.  This allows you to save your personal settings, upload photos, review your previous bookings, or plan future reservations.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>You may also wish to participate in referral programs and doing this also means providing us with personal information.  In addition to that, you can give us feedback or ask for assistance when using HalalJourney.com travel services.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>Personal information you give us about others</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>You may not just be booking accommodations for yourself.  You may also be traveling with other guests whose details you provide to us as part of the reservation, or you may make a reservation on behalf of someone else.  If you maintain a HalalJourney.com for business account with us, you can also create an address book to facilitate business travel, as well as manage the bookings of others.  In some cases, you can use HalalJouney.com to share information with others.  However we should point out that it is your responsibility to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal information about are aware that you have done this, and have accepted how HalalJourney.com uses their information.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>Personal information we collect automatically</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We may still collect certain information when you visit our websites or apps even if you do not make a reservation.  This includes your IP address, the date and time you accessed our services, the hardware, software or internet browser you used, and information about your computer's operating system such as application versions and your language settings.  We may also collect information about your clicks and which pages have been shown to you.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>If you use a mobile device, we may also collect data that identifies your mobile device, device-specific settings and characteristics, location details, app crashes and other system activity.  When you make a reservation, our system registers through which means and from which websites you have made your reservation or entered the HalalJourney.com websites and apps.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>Personal information we receive from other sources</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We may also receive information about you from other sources.  These include business partners, such as affiliate partners, and other independent third parties, and information we get from them can be combined with information provided by you.  </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Note that HalalJourney.com reservation services are not only made available through HalalJourney.com and the HalalJourney.com apps, but may also be integrated into affiliate partners' services that you can find online.  When you use some of these services, you provide the reservation details to our business partner, who then forwards your details to us.</p><div class="clear space10"></div>
 <p>We may also integrate third-party service providers to facilitate payment between bookers and accommodation providers. These service providers share payment information so we can administer and handle your reservation in the most efficient manner possible. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We may also integrate calling services into our platforms to enable you to connect with the accommodation provider about your stay, and when we do this we receive metadata about call activities (such as where you called from, who you are, and the date and length of the call).  We may also receive information about you when you use certain social media services.  For example, when you link your HalalJourney.com user account to your social media account, personal information may be shared with HalalJourney.com by that social media provider, but only when you have given your consent for them to do so. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Accommodation partners are allowed to share information about you with HalalJourney.com too and this may happen if you have support questions about your pending reservation, if a dispute arises about a reservation or where there is other communication about your reservation through HalalJourney.com.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>Why do we collect and use your personal data?</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We use the information collected about you for various purposes.  Your personal data may be used in the following ways:</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<ul>
<li>• Reservations:  principally, we use your personal data to complete and administer your online reservation.  We may also offer you other travel-related products and services from third parties.  These will be offered to you through our online services, and if you choose to utilise these, we will use your information to complete and administer your order just as we would if you booked accommodations only.</li>

<li>• Customer Service:  we provide an international customer service and we endeavour to do this 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  Sharing your details with our global customer service staff allows us to respond any time you need us, including helping you find appropriate accommodations and responding to any questions you might have about your reservation.</li>

<li>• Account Facilities:  HalalJourney.com users can create a user account on our websites or apps.  We use the information you give us to administer this account, allowing you to do a number of useful things.  You can manage your bookings or other purchases, take advantage of special offers, make future reservations, and manage your personal settings.  Managing personal settings allows you to keep and share lists, share photos, see previously searched accommodations, and check other travel-related information you have provided.  It also allows you to see any reviews you have submitted.  You can also share certain information in your user account by creating a public profile that is associated with either your own name or a username of your choice.  </li>

<li>• Online Groups:  we may also enable users with an account to join and interact with each other through online groups.  Any such activity may be made visible to other account holders or accommodation partners.</li>

<li>• Marketing Activities:  we also use your information for marketing activities. These activities may include:
<ul>
<li> Using your contact information to send you news of travel-related products and services when you make a reservation with us or set up a user account.  You can unsubscribe from these marketing communications quickly, easily and anytime – just click on the "Unsubscribe" link included in every newsletter.</li>

<li>Based on the information you share with us, individual offers might be shown to you on the HalalJourney.com website, in mobile apps, or on third-party websites/apps (including social media sites).  These might be offers that you can book directly on the HalalJourney.com site, or third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.</li>

<li> When you participate in other promotional activities (such as referral programs or competitions), relevant information will be used to administer these promotions.</li>

<li>- Communicating with you:  there may be other times when we get in touch with you, including by email, mail, phone or text message.  Which method we choose depends on the contact information you have previously shared with us and how we process the communications you send to us.  There could be a number of reasons for this, including:
<ul>
<li>• Responding to and handling any requests you or your accommodation provider has made. HalalJourney.com also offers guests and accommodation partners various means to exchange information, requests, and comments about accommodations and existing reservations directed through HalalJourney.com. (For more information, scroll down and read the section titled "How do we process communications that you and your accommodation providers send to HalalJourney.com?").</li>


<li>• If you have not finalised a reservation online, we may email you with a reminder to continue with your reservation.  We believe that this additional service benefits you as it allows you to continue with a reservation without having to search for accommodations or fill in your reservation details again.</li>


<li>• When you use our services, we might send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with HalalJourney.com.</li>

<li>• We may also send you other material related to your reservations, like how to contact HalalJourney.com if you need assistance while you are travelling and information that we feel may be useful to you in planning your trip or getting the best out of your stay.  We may also send you material related to upcoming reservations or a summary of previous reservations you made through HalalJourney.com.</li>

<li>• Even if you do not have an upcoming reservation, we may need to send you other administrative messages, which can include security alerts.</li>

<li>• Market Research:  we sometimes ask our customers to take part in market research.  Any personal details that you give us as part of the market research will be used only with your consent.</li>

<li>• Promotion of a Safe and Trustworthy Service:  in order to create a trustworthy environment for you, your fellow travellers, HalalJourney.com's business partners, and our accommodation partners, we may use personal data for the detection and prevention of fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities.  Likewise, we may use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including the authentication of users and reservations.  Occasionally, we may have to put certain reservations on hold while we undertake these processes.</li>

<li>• Improving Our Services:  we also use personal data for analytical purposes.  This is part of our desire to improve our services and enhance the user experience, but can also be used for testing purposes, troubleshooting and to improve the functionality and quality of our online travel services.  The main purpose of this is to optimise and customise our online platform to your needs, making our site easier and more productive to use.</li>

<li>• Guest Reviews and Other Destination-related Information:  during and after your stay at any accommodation you book through us, you may be invited to submit a guest review.  We may also enable guests traveling with you, or on whose behalf you have booked, to provide a review.  This invite may ask for information about the accommodation, the destination, and other services you might have booked through HalalJourney.com</li>

<li>• Account holders can choose to display a review with a screen name instead of their real name (which can be selected in the user account facility).  In addition to this, your review can be displayed anonymously.  By completing a guest review, you agree that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our Terms & Conditions) on, for example, the relevant accommodation information page on our websites, on our mobile apps, on our social media accounts and social media apps, or on the website of the relevant accommodations or business partner's website. These reviews help inform other travellers about the quality of the accommodations you stayed in, the destination you chose, or other services you used.</li> 


<li>• If you indicate whether a guest review is helpful or not, we will aggregate this with feedback from other customers in order to sort and prioritise guest reviews. We may use the information in your lists or in other destination-related information you share with us in an anonymous form, unless you have included this information in your public profile. This is to help other travellers find the right destination and the best accommodations for their needs.</li>

<li>• Call Monitoring:  when you make calls to our Customer Service Team, HalalJourney.com uses an automated telephone number detection system to relate your telephone number to your existing reservations.  This can help save time for both you and our customer support staff.  Our customer service staff may still ask for authentication, which ensures your reservation details are kept confidential. </li>

<li>• During calls with HalalJourney.com support staff, live listening may be done or calls may be recorded for quality control and training purposes.  Recordings are kept for a limited amount of time and automatically deleted, unless HalalJourney.com has a legitimate interest to keep such recording for a longer period, including for fraud investigation purposes.  Any call recordings will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>

<li>• Legal Purposes:  in certain cases we may need to use your information to handle and/or resolve legal disputes, for regulatory investigations and compliance, or to enforce the terms of use of the HalalJourney.com online reservation service.</li>

<li>To process your information as described above, we rely on the following legal causes:</li>

<li>• Performance of a Contract:  the use of your information may be necessary to perform the contract that you have with us.  For example, if you use our services and make an online reservation, we will use your information to carry out our obligation to complete and administer that reservation under the contract that we have with you.</li>

<li>• Legitimate Interests:  we may use your information for our legitimate interests, such as providing you with the most appropriate content for the website, emails and newsletters, to improve and promote our products and services and the content on our website, and for administrative, fraud detection and legal purposes.</li>

<li>• Consent:  we may rely on your consent to use your personal information for certain direct marketing purposes.  You can withdraw your consent anytime by contacting us at the address at the end of this Privacy Policy.</li>

</ul> 
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>When you make a reservation on one of our business partners' websites or apps, certain personal data that you provide to them will be forwarded to us.  If customer service is provided by the business partner, HalalJourney.com will share details relevant to your reservation with the business partners (as and when needed) in order to provide you with appropriate and efficient support.  When you make a reservation through one of our business partners' websites, the business partners may receive certain parts of your personal data related to the specific reservation. This is for their own internal purposes (such as analytical purposes) and, if requested by you, for the administration of loyalty programs or marketing.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>When you make a reservation on a business partners' website, please also read their privacy policies.  When we offer you other travel-related products and/or services, your information may be shared with the business partners who are handling and/or administering your order.  We may also exchange information with our business partners for fraud detection and prevention purposes.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How do we process communications that you and your accommodation providers send to HalalJourney.com?</h6>

<p>HalalJourney.com offers you and accommodation partners various means to communicate about accommodations and existing reservations by directing those communications through HalalJourney.com.

You may grant us access to your location data or contact details in order to provide services requested by you.  When you upload a picture from your mobile device, your picture may also be tagged with your location information.  Please read the instructions of your mobile device to understand how to change the settings and enable the sharing of such data or the receipt of push notifications.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>HalalJourney.com may make use of what is called cross-device tracking in order to optimise our services and marketing activities.  This may be done with or without the use of cookies.  For more information about cookies and other similar technologies, please see our Cookie Statement below.  With cross-device tracking, HalalJourney.com is able to track user behaviour across multiple devices.  As part of cross-device tracking, HalalJourney.com may combine data collected from a particular browser or mobile device with another computer or device linked to the computer or device from which the data was collected.</p> 
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>In order to optimise the content of the HalalJourney.com newsletter, HalalJourney.com combines the searches and reservations made from different computers and devices while you are logged into your account on each of these computers and devices.  If you do not want HalalJourney.com to combine such data for newsletter generation or to optimize the content of our websites and/or apps, either log out of a device or computer or unsubscribe from the HalalJourney.com newsletter.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Personalised advertisements shown to you on other websites or in apps can be offered based on your activities on linked computers and devices.  By opting out of the NAI behavioural advertising program (see in our Cookie Statement), you can opt out of cross-device tracking for advertisement purposes.  You should know that logging out of your user account will not actually mean that you opt out of personalised advertisements.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How does HalalJourney.com use social media?</h6>

<p>HalalJouney.com uses social media in different ways.  We use it partly to facilitate the use of online reservation services, but also to promote our business partners' travel-related products and services, and to advertise, improve and facilitate our own services.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Logging in with your social media account: We may offer you the opportunity to sign in to a Booking.com user account with your social media account, which saves you from having to remember different user names and passwords for different online services. After you've signed in once, you'll always be able to use your social media account to sign in to your Booking.com account. You can disconnect these accounts from each other at any time, too.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Integration of social media plugins:  we also have integrated social media plugins into the HalalJourney.com website and apps.  This means that when you click on one of the buttons (such as Facebook's "like" button) certain information is shared with these social media providers.  If you're logged in to your social media account at the same time, your social media provider may relate this information to your social media account and possibly present your actions on your social media profile to be shared with others in your network.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Other social media services and features:  we may also integrate other social media services (like social media messaging) to interact with HalalJourney.com or with your contacts about our services.  We may also maintain social media accounts and offer apps on several social media sites.  Whenever you connect with HalalJourney.com through social media, your social media service provider may allow you to share information with HalalJourney.com.  If you choose to share, you will generally be told by your social media provider which information will be shared.  For example, when you log in to a HalalJourney.com user account with your social media account, certain information (as authorised by you to your social media provider) may be shared with HalalJourney.com. This may include your email address, age, or profile pictures saved in your user account.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>When you register with a HalalJourney.com social media app or connect to a social media messaging service without having a HalalJourney.com user account, the information you choose to share with us may include the basic information available in your social media profile (including your email address, status updates and a list of your contacts).  We will use this information to help provide you with the service you requested.  For example, to forward a message you want to send to your contacts or to create a personalised user experience in the app itself or on our websites.  It means we can customise our services to fit your needs, connecting you and your friends with the best travel destinations and analysing and enhancing our travel-related services.  Your social media provider will be able to tell you more about how they use and process your data whenever you connect with HalalJourney.com through them.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>What security procedures does HalalJourney.com put in place to safeguard your personal data?</h6>

<p>In accordance with European data protection laws, we observe reasonable procedures to prevent unauthorised access to, and the misuse of, personal data.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We use appropriate business systems and procedures to protect and safeguard the personal data you give us.  We also use security procedures and technical and physical restrictions for accessing and using the personal data on our servers.  Only authorised personnel are permitted to access personal data in the course of their work.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>When your full credit card details are needed as part of the reservation process, they are stored by us for a maximum of ten days.  After that, your credit card data (either full or partly) will be either permanently deleted or will remain secured, with limited access, for fraud detection purposes.  You may also store your credit card details in your user account.  If you choose to do this, your credit card details will be stored in hashed form, with the exception of the last four digits of your credit card number.  That way, you will know which card you are using when you come to pay.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>How does HalalJourney.com treat personal data about children?</h6>

<p>Services offered by HalalJourney.com are not directed at children under 18 years old and ordinarily should not be used by those under 18 years old unless, exceptionally, with the consent of a parent or a guardian.

<h6>Cookie Statement</h6>

<p>Cookies and other tracking technologies can be used on our websites and apps in various ways, like making the HalalJourney.com website work, to analyse traffic, or for advertisement purposes. These technologies are either used by us directly, or by our business partners, including third-party service providers and advertisers we work with.  If you want to learn more about what a cookie is, how they're used and what your choices are, you can read more here.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>What is a cookie?</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>A cookie is a small amount of data that is placed in the browser of your computer or on your mobile device.  So-called "first-party cookies" are cookies served by the entity operating the domain through which the cookie is served.  HalalJourney.com's own cookies are therefore "first-party cookies".  If we allow others to use cookies through HalalJourney.com websites and apps, these cookies are called "third-party cookies."</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>There is also a difference between session cookies and permanent cookies.  Session cookies only exist while you are using your browser.  Permanent cookies have a longer lifespan and are not terminated when you close your browser.  We strive to serve cookies or allow the serving of cookies with a maximum lifespan of 5 years. In exceptional circumstances, like for security purposes and where absolutely necessary, our cookies may have a longer lifespan than that.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Other tracking technologies are used which are similar to cookies.  These can include web beacons (also known as pixel tags, web bugs, or gifs), tracking URLs, or software development kits (SDKs).  A web beacon is a tiny graphic image of just one pixel that can be delivered to your computer as part of a web page request in an app, in an advertisement, or in an HTML email message.  Pixels can be used to retrieve info from your device, like your device type or operating system, internet provider address, and time of your visit. They are also used to serve and read cookies in your browser.  Tracking URLs are used to understand from what referring website the HalalJourney.com websites or apps are used.  SDKs are small pieces of code included in apps that function a bit like cookies and web beacons.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>These technologies taken together are referred to in this Cookie Statement as "cookies".</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>How are cookies used?</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Cookies are used for a variety of different purposes.  They allow you to be recognised as the same user across the different pages of a website, between websites, or when you use an app.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<b>Our website and apps use cookies for different purposes:</b>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p><b>Technical Cookies:</b>  we try to give our visitors an advanced, user-friendly website and apps that adapts automatically to their needs and wishes.  To achieve this we use technical cookies to show you our website, to make it function correctly, to create your user account, to sign you in, and to manage your bookings.  These technical cookies are necessary for our website to function properly.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p><b>Functional Cookies:</b>  we also use functional cookies to remember your preferences and assist you to use our website and apps efficiently and effectively.  For example, these cookies remember your preferred currency, language, your searches, and your previously viewed accommodations.  We may also use cookies to remember your registration info so you do not have to keep retyping your login credentials every time you visit our site.  Your password will, however, always be encrypted for greater security.  These functional cookies are not absolutely necessary for our website to work, but they make it easier to use and enhance your HalalJourney.com experience.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p><b>Analytics Cookies: </b> we use these cookies to gain insights into how our visitors utilise HalalJourney.com.  This enables us to find out what works and what does not, optimise and improve our websites or apps, understand the effectiveness of advertisements and communications, and ensure we continue to be relevant and create value. The data we gather could include which web pages you have viewed, which referring and/or exit pages you have entered and left from, which platform types you have used, which emails you have opened and actioned, and date and time of these things. </p>

<p>To opt out of an NAI member's behavioural advertising program, just check the box that corresponds to the company you would like to opt out from.  You can also visit www.youronlinechoices.com or www.youradchoices.com to learn how to opt out of customised advertisements.  Your mobile device may allow you to limit the sharing of information for retargeting purposes through its settings.  Be aware that opting out of an online advertising network does not mean that you will no longer receive or be subject to online advertising or marketing analysis.  It just means the network you opted out of will not deliver advertisements customised to your web preferences and browsing patterns.</p>
