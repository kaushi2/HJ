Whenever you access, browse or use our website or any app or other software provided by us (hereinafter together referred to as the "website") and/or by making a reservation, you acknowledge that you have read, understood and are in agreement with the terms and conditions below (including the privacy statement).</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Our web site, the content of its pages, including these terms and conditions and the online reservation service provided by the web site is owned, managed and provided by HalalJourney.com and is for your personal use only, subject to the terms and conditions below.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>Definitions</h6>

<p>"HalalJourney.com", "us", "we" or "our" means Halaljourney.com is a trading name of Halaljourney Switzerland KHAN & CO, a limited liability partnership company incorporated under the laws of Switzerland with registered address  at Mettlenstrasse 31B, 8193 
Zürich Switzerland.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>"Platform" means the website and app on which the Service is owned, offered, managed and hosted by HalalJourney.com.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>"Service" means the online reservation service (including the payment mechanism) of the various products and services that may be provided by Suppliers on the Platform from time to time.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>"Supplier" means the provider of accommodation (e.g. hotel, guest house, apartment), theme parks, tourist attractions, tours and cruises of all kinds, operators, insurances, and any other accommodation, travel, tourism or related product or service as may be available for reservation on the Platform from time to time.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>1. Scope of our Service</h6>

<p>HalalJourney.com and its affiliates (and/or distribution partners and agents) provide through the Platform the opportunity for Suppliers to advertise their products and services for reservation, and through which visitors to the Platform can make such reservations via the reservation service.  By making a reservation through HalalJourney.com, you enter into a legally binding contractual relationship with the Supplier with which you make a reservation or purchase a product or service (whichever is applicable).  Whenever you make a reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Supplier, forwarding the details of your reservation to the relevant Supplier(s) and sending you a confirmation email on behalf of the Supplier.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>When providing our Service, the information that we disclose and display is based on the information provided to us by Suppliers.  Each Supplier is given access to an extranet which enables them to update all rates, availability and other information on the Platform and each is therefore fully responsible for doing this and the content that is displayed.  We provide our Service with reasonable skill and care, but we do not verify whether, and cannot guarantee that, all information is accurate, complete, correct, nor can we be held responsible for any errors (including manifest and typographical errors), any interruptions (whether due to any temporary and/or partial breakdown, repair, upgrade or maintenance of our Platform or otherwise), inaccurate, misleading, untrue information or non-delivery of information.  Each Supplier remains responsible at all times for the accuracy, completeness, correctness of the information (including descriptions, rates and availability) displayed on our Platform. </p>
<p>Our Service is provided for personal and non-commercial use only.

Standard Accommodation Rating.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>A listing on our Platform does not constitute nor should it be considered as a recommendation or endorsement of the quality, service level, qualification or rating of any Supplier (or its facilities, venue, products or services) made available for standard hotel ratings.</p>
<p>Halal Accommodation Rating</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Any halal rating score assigned to accommodation is based on either a visual inspection and/or a combination of current rating scores attributed by other halal rating service providers.  Such ratings are not ''regulated" and as such are given only as a simplified guide based on the recognized 1-5 star rating system.  HalalJourney.com cannot not be held liable for any disputes or displeasure with a halal rating as currently there are no regulated halal accommodation rating standards & guidelines that can be adhered to or taken as guidance. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>2. Pricing</h6>

<p>Prices displayed on our Platform are usually highly competitive.  Room prices are per room for your entire stay and all prices are displayed including VAT/sales tax and all other taxes (subject always to change in tax rules), unless stated otherwise on our Platform or the confirmation email/ticket.  Ticket prices are per person or per group and are subject to any validity conditions stated the ticket.  Additional fees (including tourist and city taxes) may be charged by the Supplier and also in the event that the customer fails to arrive or cancels.  Applicable taxes may be charged by the Supplier in the event that the customer fails to arrive or cancels.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Sometimes it is possible to get better rates than are available on our Platform for a specific stay, product or service, however, such rates may carry special restrictions and conditions, such as being non-cancelable and/or non-refundable.  Please check the relevant product, service and reservation conditions and details thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Any currency converter we display on our web site is for information purposes only and should not be relied upon as accurate and real time; actual rates may vary.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Obvious errors and mistakes (including misprints) are not binding on us or Suppliers.  All special offers and promotions are marked as such.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>3. Privacy and cookies</h6>

<p>HalalJourney.com respects your privacy and you are invited to read our privacy and cookies policy.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>4. Free of charge</h6>
<p>Services are free of charge to persons making reservations.  We do not add any additional reservation fees to the rate.  Suppliers pay a commission (being a small percentage of the product price (e.g. room price)) to HalalJourney.com after the end user has consumed the service or product of the Supplier or after the guest has stayed at (and paid) the accommodation.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>We reserve the right to make some additional charges (which will always be clearly displayed on our web site) where these are needed to cover the costs of managing a Platform that focuses specifically on growing consumer choice in the provision of more halal specific accommodation products, services and rating standards.</p>
<h6>5. Credit card or bank transfer</h6>

<p>Some Suppliers offer the opportunity for reservations to be paid (wholly or partly in accordance with the payment policy of the accommodation) to the Supplier during the reservation process by means of secure online payment (to the extent offered and supported by your bank).  For certain products and services, HalalJourney.com facilitates (through third-party payment processors) the payment of the relevant product or service for and on behalf of the Supplier (but HalalJourney.com never acts nor operates as the merchant of record).  In such circumstances, payment is processed from your credit/debit card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a third-party payment processor.  Any payment facilitated by us for and on behalf of, and transferred to the Supplier will in each case constitute a payment of (part of) the booking price by you of the relevant product or service in final settlement of such (partial) due and payable price and you may not reclaim such monies paid.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>For certain non-refundable rates or special offers, please note that Suppliers may require that payment is made at the outset by wire transfer (if available) or by credit card, and therefore your credit card may be pre-authorised or charged (sometimes without any option for refund) upon making the reservation.  Please check the reservation details of your product or service thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.  You may not hold HalalJourney.com liable or responsible for any authorised (or, allegedly, unauthorised or wrongful) charge by the Supplier nor (re)claim any amount for any valid or authorised charge by the Supplier (including for pre-paid rates, guest non-arrival and chargeable cancellation) of your credit card.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>6. Pre-payment, cancellation, no-show and small print</h6>
<p>When you make a reservation with a Supplier, you accept and agree to the relevant cancellation and no-show policy of that Supplier, and to any additional terms and conditions of delivery imposed by the Supplier that may apply to your visit or stay (including the small print of the Supplier made available on our Platform and the relevant business practices of the Supplier), including for services provided and/or products offered by the accommodation provider (such the delivery terms and conditions can be obtained from the relevant accommodation provider).  The general cancellation and no-show policy of each Supplier is made available on our Platform on the Supplier information pages, during the reservation procedure and in the confirmation email or ticket (as applicable).  Please note that certain rates or special offers are not eligible for cancellation or variation.  Applicable city/tourist tax may still be charged by the Supplier in the event of a no-show or charged cancellation.   Please check the reservation details of your product or service thoroughly for any such conditions prior to making your reservation.  Please note that a reservation which requires prior payment or (wholly or partly) prepayment may still be cancelled by the Supplier (without a prior notice of default or warning) but the relevant (remaining) amount(s) cannot be collected in full on the relevant payment date in accordance with the relevant payment policy of the Supplier and the reservation.  Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary according to room type.  Please read carefully the small print (below the room types or at the bottom of each Supplier page on our Platform) and any pertinent and/or "important information" heading in your reservation confirmation for additional policies as may be applied by the Supplier (e.g. in respect of age requirements, security deposits, non-cancellation/additional supplements for group bookings, extra beds/no free breakfasts, pets, cards accepted, etc).  Late payment, wrong bank, debit or credit card details, invalid credit/debit cards or insufficient funds are for your own risk and account and you shall not be entitled to any refund of any non-refundable prepaid amount unless the Supplier agrees or otherwise allows under its (pre)payment and cancellation policy.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>In the event that you wish to review, adjust or cancel your reservation, please revert to the confirmation email and follow the instructions stated.  Please note that you may be charged for your cancellation in accordance with the Supplier's cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy or not be entitled to any repayment of any (pre)paid amount.  We recommend that you read the cancellation, (pre)payment and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully prior to making your reservation and remember to make further payments on time as may be required for the relevant reservation.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>If you have a late or delayed arrival on the check-in date or intend to arrive the next day, make sure you promptly communicate this to the Supplier so they will know when to expect you and so you may attempt to avoid cancellation of your reservation or room or charge of the no-show fee.  Our customer service department may be able to assist you with informing the Supplier.  HalalJourney.com will not accept any liability or responsibility for the consequences of your delayed arrival or any cancellation or charged no-show fee by the Supplier.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>7.  Further correspondence and communication</h6>

<p>By making a reservation, you agree to receive (i) an email which we may send you prior to your arrival date, giving information on your destination and certain other information and offers (including third party offers to the extent that you have actively opted in for this) relevant to your reservation and destination, and (ii) an email which we may send to you after your stay inviting you to complete our guest review form.  Please see our privacy and cookies policy for more information about how we may contact you.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>HalalJourney.com disclaims any and all liability or responsibility for any communication with the Supplier on or through its platform.  You cannot derive any rights from any request to, or communication with, the Supplier or acknowledgement of receipt of any communication or request.  HalalJourney.com cannot guarantee that any request or communication will be duly and promptly received, read by, complied with, executed or accepted by the Supplier.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>To complete and secure your reservation, you will need to use your correct email address.  We are not responsible or liable for, and have no obligation to verify, any wrong or misspelled email address or inaccurate or wrong phone / mobile number or credit card number.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Any claim or complaint against HalalJourney.com or in respect of the Service must be submitted promptly, but in any event within 20 working days after the scheduled day of your use of the product or service (e.g. your check out date).  Any claim or complaint that is submitted after 20 days may be rejected and the claimant shall forfeit its right to any compensation.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<h6>8. Ranking, preferred program, stars, HJ rating and guest reviews</h6>

<p>The Suppliers on our Platform have a default setting ranking of "Recommended" or similar wording (the "Default Ranking").  For your perusal we also offer other ways to rank a Supplier.  Note that the Default Ranking is created through a fully automatic ranking system (algorithm) and based on multiple criteria.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>HalalJourney.com operates a preferred partnership program in certain cities and regions which may allow Suppliers that meet and maintain the preferred program terms to be listed ahead of the rest of the Suppliers in the default "Recommended" ranking for the relevant city/region.  We mark these preferred Suppliers with a "crescent moon" symbol and in return for this high ranking, such a Supplier pays a higher commission.  Only Suppliers that meet and maintain the qualification criteria can be listed as preferred.</p>
<p>The rating stars used for hotel accommodation are based on either a visual inspection and/or a combination of current rating tends by other halal rating accommodation service providers.  Such ratings are not ''regulated" and as such are given only as a simplified guide based on the recognized 1-5 star rating system.  HalalJourney.com cannot not be held liable for any disputes or displeasure with a halal rating as currently there are no regulated halal accommodation rating standards & guidelines that can be adhered to or taken as guidance. </p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>All hotels are given the opportunity to agree or arbitrate their rating through our affiliate partner program.  No person may raise any claim, dispute, protest or objection about the manner in which the rating has been awarded, calculated or arbitrated.  Ultimately, all our ratings are subjective assessments and we are presently working with third-parties to standardize our approach according to more stringent objective criteria.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
<p>Stars (and other rating symbols) used for non-hotel accommodations do not necessarily correspond to the star ranking system that is applied to hotel accommodations.
Completed guest reviews may be (a) uploaded onto the relevant Supplier's information page on our Platform for the sole purpose of informing future customers of your opinion of the service and quality of the Supplier, and (b) wholly or partly used and placed by HalalJourney.com at its sole discretion on our Platform (e.g. for marketing, promotion or improvement) or such social media outlets, newsletters, special promotions, apps or other channels owned, hosted, used or controlled by HalalJourney.com and others.  We reserve the right to adjust, refuse or remove reviews solely at our discretion.  The guest review form primarily takes the form of a survey and will not be used to make further commercial offers, invitations or incentives.</p>
<div class="clear space10"></div>
